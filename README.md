# GridWorld-RL
This project implements a Grid World environment for Reinforcement Learning. It includes solutions for Value Iteration, Model-Based RL, and Model-Free RL, and provides a manual control interface using Pygame. Players can navigate through the grid, encountering rewards and penalties, and visualize the learning process in real-time.
